# Supervised Machine Learning Models

## Overview
This repository contains basic supervised machine learning models trained on different datasets. The goal is to implement fundamental algorithms, understand their working, and evaluate their performance.

## Models Implemented
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Navie Bayse

## Datasets Used
Various datasets have been used to train and test the models, covering regression and classification problems.

## Requirements
To run the models, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Future Enhancements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- More advanced algorithms
- Model deployment

Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements!
